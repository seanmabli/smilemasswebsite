      <p>
        SMILE Mass has created a junior and adult Ambassador team. Our motto is
        “We run for all those who can’t.” SMILE Mass Ambassadors get the
        privilege to enable kids and adults with disabilities the chance to do
        it all! Our Ambassadors will support a Captain (individual with
        disabilities) through an entire race, allowing them their moment of
        glory of finishing a road race; being part of their community, doing
        what so many families take for granted!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p className="bold">This is how it works:</p>
      <br />
      <ul className="dashed">
        <li>
          An Ambassador is anyone who is able to run or walk a 5K road race.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a SMILE Mass Ambassador, you commit to run a minimum of 3 – 5 races
          with SMILE Mass.&nbsp;You can take part in the races listed to the
          right or in any race of your choosing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adult Ambassadors can simply run a road race for SMILE Mass or they
          can choose to assist a Duo athlete to complete a road race, in which
          case you will become the eyes, ears or legs for the Duo athlete.
        </li>
        <li>
          Junior Ambassadors run the 5K road race and receive their finish time.
          After finishing, if they choose, they can go back out on the race
          route to assist the Adult Ambassador to cross the finish line with a
          Duo athlete. The goal of the junior ambassador team is to promote
          inclusion, build self-confidence and teach our children that we can
          all make a difference.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Run for Free</b>&nbsp;– All fees pertaining to any road race you
          wish to participate in, must be paid by the runner themselves.
          However, if you wish to take part in the fundraising efforts on behalf
          of SMILE Mass, through the various fundraising opportunities we have
          available, or simply by setting up a fundraising page, SMILE Mass will
          set aside 50% of what you raise to cover registration fees, t-shirts,
          and any other expenses pertaining to the road races you participate
          in.
        </li>
        <li>
          Being an Ambassador for SMILE Mass means you can run your own road
          races of your choice, in your neighborhood, town or city, while
          wearing SMILE Mass running apparel, or simply tap into the SMILE Mass
          road races already arranged. If you are fundraising for SMILE Mass,
          all you have to do is send us your registration receipt and we will
          reimburse you. Furthermore, if you are running with a loved one with
          disabilities, let us know so that we can get you the proper equipment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Duo athletes are special-needs children and young adults of any
          ability who will either be pushed in specialized joggers (200 lb.
          limit) or, if able, they can bike, walk, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Duo runners are adults willing to assist a Duo athlete, often times
          pushing them in a specialized jogging stroller through a road race.
        </li>
        <li>
          Duo athletes participate free of charge for any road race organized by
          SMILE Mass. For races organized by others, Duo athletes will need to
          go through the standard registration process in order to receive a
          race bib number (if they wish to receive a recorded time).
