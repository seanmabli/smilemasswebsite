      <h1>Susan Brown's Story</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        My oldest daughter, Kristen, had to have brain surgery when she was 3
        years old to stop seizures which could not be controlled with
        medication. The great news is she no longer has seizures. The bad news
        is, due to the brain surgery she is developmentally delayed and has some
        mobility issues.

        What we have experienced during this journey is that every accommodation
        for disabled persons costs an extraordinary amount of money.&nbsp;
        Kristen is high functioning but there are times that she needs a
        wheelchair for family outings that require a lot of walking or for
        family vacations.&nbsp; She also needed a therapy bike so she can bike
        along with her siblings.&nbsp; These expenses add up significantly over
        time.

        Kristen is a very happy young adult now and her smile melts our hearts.
        Despite the fact that Kristen is very high functioning, she is not a
        typical young adult. She still takes medication twice a day. Her therapy
        related sports activities include therapeutic horseback riding and
        special needs basketball. I work hard for SMILE Mass to give Kristen a
        place that she feels like she belongs.

        Regardless of a childâ€™s disability, all parents want their kids to
        belong. They want them to have friends, a social circle and a sense of
        community that leads to fulfillment in life.&nbsp; That is why I joined
        Lotte in this journey to create SMILE Mass.&nbsp; I want Kristen and all
        disabled individuals to have a place to belong and to be able to afford
        the necessities that are part of being an active participant in our
        program.&nbsp; Together we are creating an inclusive community for all
        abilities.&nbsp; &nbsp;
