      <h2>Welcome to the SMILE Mass Transition Resources Page</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In a world of raising children and adults with disabilities, the only
        thing that is guaranteed is constant change. New laws, IEPs,
        requirements, and lots and lots of paperwork. We have created this
        resource page with the hope that this can save you some time, and
        perhaps even give you some of the answers you might be looking for.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        A life transition is a journey. A passage from one life stage to
        another. For young adults with special needs “transition” commonly
        refers to the progression from school to adult life in the wider
        community.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Many families have described the special needs transition process as
        “falling off a cliff,” due to the loss of school-based services provided
        to their children under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
        (IDEA). Children covered by the IDEA receive services as an entitlement.
        After graduation, however, there is no automatic right to
        disability-related services, and parents and guardians must work with
        state and federal agencies to put together a package of services and
        supports that will best meet their adult children’s needs. Support is
        available to assist your child with many issues s/he may face in adult
        life, including: employment, housing, and medical care, along with cash
        benefits for those unable to work. While a variety of services can be
        funded and managed through state and federal programs, you need to know
        where to look and plan wisely to ensure that your loved one can maximize
        his/her benefits.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Under the IDEA, the transition process begins when a student turns 14.
        At this point (and no later than age 16), school and district personnel
        should be working with the student and his/her family to explore
        available options and services that will enable the student to live a
        meaningful adult life in the community following graduation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Transition encompasses much more that the progression from the school
        system to the adult disability services world, however. Families must
        also consider issues involving legal decision-making authority,
        financial planning, housing, and vocational or day habilitation
        placements for their adult children.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        While not a comprehensive guide, SMILE Mass’s Transition Resource page
        will provide you with materials and links to explore so that you will
        have a better idea of the services and options available for your
        soon-to-be adult child. With knowledge and planning, the transition
        process doesn’t have to feel like you and your family are falling off a
        cliff; instead, you can view this time as an opportunity to guide your
        child to a fulfilling adult life.
