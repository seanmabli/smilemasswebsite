      <p>
        You donâ€™t actually have to drink coffee to join the club. But if you are
        like millions of Americans, you will consume two or more cups of coffee
        a day. Would you donate the cost of one cup of coffee a month to SMILE
        Mass?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With the continued growth of SMILE Mass, it is vital that we create
        sustainability. That is why your VIP Coffee Club donation of $5 or $10 a
        month is so important to SMILE Mass. It would help us continue the many
        programs we are currently running and it will help us start a
        scholarship fund that will allow us to host low income and at risk
        families so they can enjoy a week at our accessible vacation rental in
        Truro, MA. With your support, we can continue to build a better
        tomorrow, a world without barriers.
