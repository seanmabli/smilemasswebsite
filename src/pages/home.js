        For people with medical, physical and intellectual disabilities movement
        can often be challenging, yet the benefit is the same. A moving body is
        a healthy body and we need to move to stimulate the frontal lobe so we
        can stimulate communication, happiness, personality, behavior just to
        name a few of the benefits of a moving body. Welcome to Club SMILE Mass.
