      <h1>Lotte Diomede's Story</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Because I like to relax, enjoy myself with my family, and take a respite
        from all the requirements of the daily grind, I have started SMILE Mass.
        This foundation seeks to enable individuals and families with a disabled
        member to enjoy a getaway similar to those who have no special needs and
        to give those with special needs a place to belong and a place where
        they can be encouraged to move and stimulate their brain.

        I know how difficult traveling with a handicapped family member can be;
        I speak of it first-hand. My son Nicholas was born premature in 2000
        with buildup of fluid on his brain. This condition, known as
        Hydrocephaly, creates many disadvantages for a growing child. Nicholas
        faces numerous obstacles every single day of his life, everything from
        getting out of bed to feeding himself – things an individual with a
        normal functioning brain can do for themselves multiple times daily. He
        has been in a wheelchair his entire life and requires constant
        assistance from our family, his teachers, and friends.

        In addition, Nicholas is on a special diet, which requires that he not
        consume any sugar or carbohydrates, which could bring on a seizure. He
        also has sensory issues, which cause him to get nervous and sometimes
        hyperventilate in unfamiliar surroundings. He requires oxygen at night
        and receives medication five times every day. Why am I telling you all
        this? Because even though Nicholas has these obstacles, he can smile at
        the warmth of the sun on his face; he senses when I am relaxed and
        enjoying time with my family; he knows when those around him are
        content. He is an amazing inspiration to the rest of my family. I
        consider us fortunate that Nicholas is always happy. He rarely
        complains. His spirit is my lifeline. Knowing the big struggles he goes
        through every day puts my life in perspective. ​

        ​He has an older sister, who never resents when thing don’t always go
        her way. The sacrifices she has had to make over the years are not
        always easy to justify as a parent. Until now, I could only dream of a
        vacation where we had all the equipment we needed, a place where my
        daughter can feel just as special, a place away from home where we could
        build memories that would last a lifetime. ​
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It is this dream that I would like to make a reality for any family that
        experiences a similar situation in life. I feel so lucky to have great
        friends and family who believe in my mission to change lives, one family
        at a time. I owe my mission to Nicholas and if it weren’t for him, who
        knows if this is the path I would have chosen.
