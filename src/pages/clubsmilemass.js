      <p>
        Club SMILE Mass is our newest and fastest growing program. Created for
        adults and children with disabilities, this program is designed for
        socialization and movement.

      <p>
        Our members want to have fun, be part of a community, and take care of
        their health. With this program, members will enjoy fun classes led by
        our outstanding team. They will continue to see and hear familiar faces
        and voices, they will make friends, and they will move their bodies. We
        all know movement is essential for physical and mental health –
        improving mood and brain function.

      <p>
        We also ensure we meet each member at their current level, while working
        with them to grow stronger and more confident. We’ve seen incredible
        progress from our members!
